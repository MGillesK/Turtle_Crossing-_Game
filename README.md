# Turtle_Crossing-_Game

This game is composed of 3 classes :
  - Player : for the turtle. Via this file, we control the turtle's movement and make sure it's going back to the beginningwhen it reaches a new level
  - Scoreboard : to show the score and displays GAME OVER when we lose
  - Car manager : this class controls all the car (colored rectangles)

For the car manager class, all the colored rectangles are added to a "car park" which is a list. Cpntrolling this list allows to control all the cars at once.
